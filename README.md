# desktop-kirby
Python app taken inspiration from Desktop Goose, with Kirby instead :)
Currently the project is only working on Windows (I ran into an issue with Tkinter library on MacOS not having transparency support).
You can download the exe installer in the /install folder, or build your own installer using the source files!


The code is written by me using Tkinter in Python 3, and all source code is included in this repo.
All kirby assets are created by me in Blender, except for the ones in the images/ folder.
Windows installer/executables were made using NSIS and auto-py-to-exe.

Please follow the GNU General Public License v3.0 rules if you want to use this code. A copy of the license is included in this repo.
