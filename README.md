# desktop-kirby
Python app taken inspiration from Desktop Goose, with Kirby instead :)

The code is written by me using tkinter in Python 3, and all source code is included in this repo.
All kirby assets are created by me in Blender, except for the ones in the images/ folder.
Windows installer/executables were made using NSIS and auto-py-to-exe.

Please follow the GNU General Public License v3.0 rules if you want to use this code. A copy of the license is included in this repo.
